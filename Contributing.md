Contributing to LUMIN

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LUMIN, the ethical-governance engine built on the ODG / ACI4A architecture and developed by AHALASec.
This document provides guidelines for submitting code, reporting issues, and participating in research or development.

LUMIN is a safety-critical, civilizational-grade system.
All contributions must follow the standards of transparency, reproducibility, and ethical responsibility defined by AHALASeC.

1. Code of Conduct
By contributing to LUMIN, you agree to:
→ respect ethical research principles
→ avoid introducing unsafe, opaque, or unverifiable behavior
→ follow deterministic and symbolic-governance design rules
→ ensure your contributions support transparency, auditability, and civilizational safety

LUMIN does not accept:
→ black-box safety mechanisms
→ undocumented behavioral changes
→ contributions that weaken auditability
→ experimental features without review
→ unsafe or ambiguous logic pathways

2. How to Contribute
There are several ways to contribute:
→ Reporting Bugs
→ Open an issue describing:
→ the problem
→ steps to reproduce
→ expected behavior
→ environment (Python version, OS, model used)

Improving Documentation
You may propose edits to:
→ README.md
→ ARCHITECTURE.md
→ QUICKSTART.md
→ ROADMAP.md
→ RepositoryStructure.md

Clear documentation is essential for a governance engine.

Contributing Code
Pull requests should follow these rules:
→ Fork the repository
→ Create a feature branch
→ Write clear commit messages
→ Document all new functions/modules
→ Add tests when possible
→ Ensure no formatting breaks occur
→ Submit a PR with a description of the change

All PRs undergo review by AHALASec maintainers.

3. Development Standards
Language and Style
→ Python 3.10+
→ Follow PEP 8
→ Use descriptive names
→ Prefer deterministic logic over heuristics
→ Prefer symbolic computation over probabilistic shortcuts

Safety Requirements
Any change to:
→ FSM logic
→ axioms
→ the safeguard
→ the MIE Guardian
→ the ledger
→ probabilistic components

must include:
→ explanation
→ justification
→ reproducibility tests

4. Repository Structure Reference
This project follows a strict structural hierarchy defined in RepositoryStructure.md.

Key folders:

/lumin
  LUMIN.py
  /engine
  /config
  /ledger

Do not create new top-level folders without approval.

5. Pull Request Checklist
Before submitting a PR:
→ code is clean and readable
→ logic is deterministic
→ no unnecessary dependencies added
→ documentation updated
→ roadmap impact considered
→ formatting verified in GitHub preview
→ no emojis in headings (formatting issue)
→ no long unbroken lines
→ no breaking of markdown rendering

PRs that fail GitHub formatting checks will be rejected.

6. Security and Vulnerability Reporting
For sensitive issues, see SECURITY.md.
Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

7. Research Contributions
LUMIN welcomes contributions in:
→ symbolic governance theory
→ civilizational safety models
→ axiomatic ethics
→ semantic vector fields
→ prognostic alignment frameworks
→ multi-agent governance architectures

Submit a proposal via issue or email.

8. Licensing
All contributions are licensed under AGPL-3.0.
By submitting a PR, you agree that your work will be released under this license.

Summary

Contributing to LUMIN means contributing to:
→ deterministic safety
→ transparent governance
→ symbolic ethics
→ auditable AI infrastructure
→ civilizational-scale alignment

We appreciate your commitment to building the next generation of human-aligned intelligence.
